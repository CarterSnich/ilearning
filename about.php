					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;One of the problems of the educational system today is the continuous growth of student population in a classroom, especially in Mayorga National High School. For this reason, the students of Eastern Visayas State University responded to the call of Grade 12 CSS students of Mayorga National High School and planned for the implementation of Alternative Delivery Mode (ADM) especially to secondary schools that lack classrooms. After a thorough study, iLearning was created. iLearning is a modern and effective method of teaching and learning process. This was already implemented in the different parts of the world and even in some prestigious universities in our country. The iLearning Program is now one of the Alternative Delivery Modes offered by the Schools Division of Mayorga National High School to provide an option for learners in availing educational services. Its full implementation hoped to have strong impact on learning outcomes and improve school’s key performance indicators, which supports the mission and vision of the Division. With the theme, “Creating Better Opportunities for Learners and Teachers through ICT,” the program focuses on giving the students quality education anytime, anywhere via Electronic Learning.
